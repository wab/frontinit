Sage is a WordPress starter theme with a modern development workflow.

Write stylesheets with Sass, automatically check your JavaScript for errors, optimize images, enable synchronized browser testing, and more.

## Features

* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used as a build tool for compiling stylesheets, checking for JavaScript errors, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying files
* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for keeping multiple browsers and devices synchronized while testing, along with injecting updated CSS and JS into your browser while you're developing
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Template inheritance with the [theme wrapper](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-wrapper/)
* ARIA roles and microformats
* Posts use the [hNews](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews) microformat
* [Multilingual ready](https://roots.io/wpml/) and over 30 available [community translations](https://github.com/roots/sage-translations)

Install the [Soil](https://roots.io/plugins/soil/) plugin to enable additional recommended features:

* Load jQuery from the jQuery CDN
* Cleaner WordPress markup
* Cleaner HTML output of navigation menus
* Root relative URLs
* Nice search
* Google Analytics snippet from [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* Move all JS to the footer
* Disable trackbacks and pingbacks

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 5.5.x
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 0.12.x

## Theme installation

From the command line, run the following commands from the root of your WordPress site (where `composer.json` exists). These instructions assume you're using a [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)-based WordPress setup. If you're using Vagrant, make sure to run these commands from the Vagrant box (`vagrant ssh`). Create a new theme based on Sage by using Composer's [`create-project`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#create-project):

```shell
# @ example.com/site
$ composer create-project roots/sage web/app/themes/your-theme-name 9.0.0-alpha.1
```

Then activate the theme via [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/commands/theme/activate/):

```shell
# @ example.com/site
$ wp theme activate your-theme-name
```

## Theme structure

## Theme setup

Edit `src/lib/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine (not on your Vagrant development box), navigate to the theme directory then run `npm install`:

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/your-theme-name
$ npm install
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available build commands

* `npm run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `npm run watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start BrowerSync session
* `npm run build:production` — Compile assets for production

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `npm watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `https://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "devUrl": "https://project-name.dev",
...
```

If you are not using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), you should also update `publicPatch` to reflect your folder strutcture.

If your theme is placed in folder called `sage` in a standard wordpress setup it should look like this:
```json
...
  "output": {
    "path": "dist",
    "publicPath": "/wp-content/themes/sage/dist/"
  }
...
```
